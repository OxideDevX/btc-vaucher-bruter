##BTC voucher generator

***Hey. This project was created by OxideDevX.***

*What it is?*
It is BTC check generator.
The script generates links for cashing BTC checks in the @btc_change_bot bot.
We generate links and follow them, if we're lucky, we cash the check.
To work, you need a PC or a server with Python (or just an online service like "programiz.com").

How to install (for Linux and Termux):

    apt update -y && apt upgrade -y

    apt install git python -y

    pip install requests

Download the script itself:

    git clone https://github.com/OxideDevX/btc-vaucher-bruter.git

    cd BTCVoucherGen

Run the script with the command:

    python BTCCheckGen.py

Next, the script will run and start generating links.
If everything is done correctly, the script will generate links of this type for you:

You can run the script on any online service,
example: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/
To do this, you just need to copy the Python code into the input field on the above site and click the "Run" button.
Good luck searching!
